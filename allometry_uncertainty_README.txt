Methodological information:
Methods follow Alexander et al. in prep.  aka: Valles Caldera Uncertainty paper

CI around mean pertains only to allometric spread in the data.  Allometric equations were chosen from PEcAn, and PIPO allometries were adapted from Chojnacky et al. 2013.

Stacked data frame with headers: Year, SiteID, Mean, LB, UB 

mean—mean allometry biomass for a given site kg/m2.  Calculated using PEcAn allometry scripts.

LB—lower bound of 95% CI around mean allometry biomass kg/m2

UB—upper bound of 95% CI around mean allometry biomass kg/m2 

SiteID: List of Sites included in DOE analysis, this will be updated as more sites come online.  As of 4/28/15 Three sites are included: VUF—Valles Caldera Spruce site; VLF—Valles Calder Ponderosa pine site; MMF—Morgan Monroe State forest data.

Year—Years starting at 2014; Note that Valles sampling occurred in 2012 and therefore should only be displayed from 1903-2011
