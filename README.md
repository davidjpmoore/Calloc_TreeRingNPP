# Calloc_TreeRingNPP
Process raw increments from cores to estimate aboveground NPP

These are scripts developed by Ross Alexander & Christy Rollinson to convert tree ring widths to total biomass and biomass increment.  The master branch contains the basic workflow; the Uncertainy-MS branch contains the code used to quantify uncertainties around the forest-level biomass estimates (in progress manuscript).
